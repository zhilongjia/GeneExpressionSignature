\title{Compute pairwise distances between samples with method in package PGSEA}
\usage{
ScorePGSEA(MergingSet, SignatureLength, ScoringDistance = c("avg", "max"),
  p.value = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{MergingSet}{an ExpressionSet object. The assay data represents the
PRLs of the samples, each column represents one PRL. The number of sample
must be greater than 1, oherwise, this function is not meaningful.}

\item{SignatureLength}{the length of "gene signature". In order to compute
pairwise distances among samples, genes lists are ranked according to the
gene expression ratio (fold change). And the "gene signature" includes the
most up-regulated genes (near the top of the list) and the most
down-regulated genes (near the bottom of the list).}

\item{ScoringDistance}{the distance measurements between PRLs: the Average
Enrichment Score Distance (avg), or the Maximum Enrichment Score Distance
(max).}

\item{p.value}{logical, if TRUE return a matrix of p.values of the distance
matrix, default FALSE}
}
\description{
Compute pairwise distances between sample according to their (Prototype
Ranked List) PRL, get a N x N distance matrix is generated by calling this
function , N is the length of PRL.
}
\details{
This function has the same function with ScoreGSEA, just with different
methods.
}
\examples{

# load the sample expressionSet
data(exampleSet)

# Merging each group of the ranked lists in the exampleSet with the same 
# phenotypic data into a single PRL
MergingSet=RankMerging(exampleSet,"Spearman")

# get the distance matrix
ds=ScorePGSEA(MergingSet,250, ScoringDistance="avg")
