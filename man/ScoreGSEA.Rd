\title{Compute pairwise distances between samples with method in package GSEA}
\usage{
ScoreGSEA(MergingSet, SignatureLength, ScoringDistance = c("avg", "max"),
  p.value = F, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{MergingSet}{an ExpressionSet object. The assay data represents the
PRLs of the samples, each column represents one PRL. The number of sample of
this argument must be greater than 1, otherwise, this function is not
meaningful.}

\item{SignatureLength}{the length of "gene signature". In order to compute
pairwise distances among samples, genes lists are ranked according to the
gene expression ratio (fold change). And the "gene signature" includes the
most up-regulated genes (near the top of the list) and the most
down-regulated genes (near the bottom of the list).}

\item{ScoringDistance}{the distance measurements between PRLs: the Average
Enrichment Score Distance (avg), and the Maximum Enrichment Score Distance
(max).}

\item{p.value}{logical, if TRUE return a matrix of p.values of the distance
matrix, default FALSE}

\item{verbose}{verbose}
}
\value{
an distance-matrix, the max distance is more sensitive to weak
similarities, providing a lower precision but a larger recall.

If p.value is set to TRUE, then a list is returned that consists of the
distance matrix as well as their p.values, otherwise, without p.vlues in the
result.
}
\description{
Compute pairwise distances between sample according to their (Prototype
Ranked List) PRL, a N x N distance matrix is generated by calling this
function, N is the length of PRL.
}
\details{
Once the PRL obtained for each sample, the distances between samples are
calculated base on gene signature, including the expression of genes that
seemed to consistently vary in response to the across different experimental
conditions (e.g., different cell lines and different dosages). We take two
distance measurements between PRLs: the Average Enrichment-Score Distance
Davg=(TESx,y+TESy,x)/2, and the Maximum Enrichment-Score Distance
Dmax=Min(TESx,y,TESy,x)/2.The avg is more stringent than max, where max is
more sensitive to weak similarities, with lower precision but large recall.

\examples{

# load the sample expressionSet
data(exampleSet)

# Merging each group of the ranked lists in the exampleSet with the 
# same phenotypic data into a single PRL
MergingSet=RankMerging(exampleSet,"Spearman")

# get the distance matrix
ds=ScoreGSEA(MergingSet,250,"avg")
