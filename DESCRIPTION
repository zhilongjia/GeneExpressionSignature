Description: This package gives the implementations of the gene
    expression signature and its distance to each. Gene expression
    signature is represented as a list of genes whose expression is
    correlated with a biological state of interest. And its
    distance is defined using a nonparametric, rank-based
    pattern-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
    statistic. Gene expression signature and its distance can be
    used to detect similarities among the signatures of drugs,
    diseases, and biological states of interest.
